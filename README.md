Codecombat-Vagrant
==================
This is a work in progress. Not guarenteed to work. This script assumes you have codecombat checked out to a folder called codecombat sitting alongside this directory.  
1. Start an administrative command prompt. This will ensure symlinks will work correctly.  
2. Run vagrant up  
3. Run vagrant ssh  
4. Try running sudo python /coco/scripts/devSetup/setup.py
